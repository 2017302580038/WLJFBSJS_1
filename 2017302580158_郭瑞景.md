# 1. ping another PC

Open cmd and input `ping 192.168.3.3`, which is the IP address of another PC within the same LAN. But first we have to configure some firewall settings of the PC to allow this to happen.

TTL being 128 means that packets traveled through 255 - 128 = 127 routers to get to destination point.

# 2. tracert a server

`traceroute` and `tracert` are computer network diagnostic commands for displaying the route (path) and measuring transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

Request timeout may be because the firewall blocked the ICMP echo reply.

-d    Do not resolve addresses to hostnames.

-w timeout    Wait timeout in milliseconds for each reply.

-h maximum_hops    Maximum number of hops to search for the target.
